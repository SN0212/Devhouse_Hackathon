# IoT Security Firewall & Pentest Tool

### ESP32 Firewall  
- Real-time attack detection using entropy and behavioral analysis  
- Adaptive learning with MinHash and TTL-based expiry  
- Designed for resource-constrained embedded devices  

### Python Pentest Tool  
- Simulates 50+ IoT-based exploits  
- Covers hardware and network attack vectors  
- Generates automated JSON reports for analysis  

### Quick Start  
1. Flash `esp32_firewall.ino` to your ESP32  
2. Run penetration tests with:  
   cmd - python hardware_attack_v4.py
bash - python3 hardware_attack_v4.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --test critical

### Key Metrics  
- 90% detection accuracy  
- Less than 10% false positive rate   

### Ideal For  
- Smart home environments  
- Industrial IoT infrastructures  
- Cybersecurity researchers and analysts
