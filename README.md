ESP32 Real-Time Cyberattack Detection using TinyML

ðŸš€ Real-time network attack detection using ESP32 in promiscuous mode and a trained deep learning model (TinyML). This project captures WiFi packets, extracts key features, classifies them as normal or attack traffic using a lightweight neural network, and triggers alerts.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview:

This project detects cyberattacks (e.g., SYN Flood, UDP Flood, ICMP Flood, Port Scans) in real-time using ESP32 as a packet sniffer and a pre-trained neural network (converted to C array format for deployment). The attack classification results are logged and analyzed using Python & Scapy.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:

âœ” ESP32 in WiFi Promiscuous Mode for packet sniffing

âœ” Feature extraction (Protocol, Ports, TTL, Packet Size, etc.)

âœ” TinyML Model for cyberattack classification

âœ” Alerts on detected attacks via Serial Monitor

âœ” Python-based attack traffic generator

âœ” Live logging to CSV for analysis
